# Project TING

The objective of this project was to develop a program that simulates an algorithm of document indexing similar to that of Google. The program must be able to identify occurrences of terms in TXT files.

For this, the program developed has two modules:

File management module that allows you to attach text files (TXT format) and;
Search module that allows operating search functions on attached files.
In this project we will not focus on analyzing meanings or searching for synonyms.
